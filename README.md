# Smartodo

A todo app that uses Firebase to store tasks.

## Usage

1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/juan-sierra/Smartodo.git`

2. If you created a project through the firebase website they should have provided you with a script to put in your app. Replace the script noted inside the index.html with the script that was provided to you by firebase.

3. *This step is completely optional* - Run a local webserver if on Mac OS, you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` - if you have browser-sync installed you can run `browser-sync start --server --files './**'`  if you don't want to run a webserver you can just open index.html.

4. That's it!
